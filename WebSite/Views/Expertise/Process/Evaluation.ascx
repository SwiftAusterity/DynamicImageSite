                    As the campaign is rolled out and officially hits the pavement, it’s time to start
                    observing and tweaking if necessary. We base success on KPI evaluation, fiscal
                    achievement and meeting brand goals. This is an opportunity to see which executions
                    were most effective and then using those findings to influence future campaigns.
